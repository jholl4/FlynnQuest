Flynn Quest is a short, classic text-based adventure dungeon-crawl game that is run in the terminal.

This game is a project that I developed as an assignment during an immersive Java training program with SkillStorm.

It's also named after my son, Flynn, who helped me with designing the dungeon layout and scenarios.

If you would like to give it a try, you can find the latest release version on the right side of the project's GitHub page.

I have squashed most of the bugs, but there are still some small issues that pop up if playing the game multiple times in one session.
If you encounter this bug, please let me know what actions led to it so that I can narrow it down and squash it too :)
